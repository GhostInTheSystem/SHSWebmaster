There are many privacy concerns associated with drones, and their ability to capture with less restrictions than a human photographer is the biggest reason for that. These devices allow can cause privacy intrusions and take pictures of people’s personal lives. There are rules to prevent the drones from capturing pictures inside or near houses; In 1946, the U.S Supreme Court decided in the case U.S. v Causby that homeowner property rights extended only 83 feet above the ground. This prevents low-flying drones from taking private pictures, but doesn’t prevent drones above 83 feet using a higher resolution and more powerful camera. The potential for drones to open otherwise closed doors, has been a concern of several people.
