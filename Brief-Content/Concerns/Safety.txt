Drones have massive safety concerns. Drones typically are lightweight, to make it more easy to fly. But the drones fly at a high height, and if any of the drone’s systems go offline or become damaged, the drone becomes a projectile hurtling towards the ground. In fact, in September 2013, a man’s own drone decapitated him while flying it in Brooklyn Park. Another safety concern regarding drones involves air traffic. Between March 2014 and December 2014, the FAA has reported close to 200 incidents involving drones navigating alarmingly close to manned aircraft. The FAA does require that drones be flown under 400 feet, but the chance of interfering with manned traffic is still present and presents a very distinct risk.
