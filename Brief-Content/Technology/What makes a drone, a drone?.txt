A drone typically contains multiple rotors which aid in controlling flight. Cameras are also attached onto the drone, for photographic use. Controllers are linked to a chip inside the drone, which in then controls the speed of the rotors. The speed of the rotors is the only event that controls the drone, directionally. A controller uses radio waves in order to communicate, specifically a 2.4 gigahertz radio waves. The controller sends signals to this chip, which in turn translates the signal into a set speed for the four rotors. The drone also has GPS embedded inside of it, for accurate tracking ability. GPS chips are also essential to allow for pre programmed routes. Drones are battery powered aircraft. Batteries, however, are heavy. The drone structure is built with lightweight materials. Large batteries to provide longer flying time to drones weigh the drone down, so on average, the less heavy battery can provide up to 12 minutes of flying time.
