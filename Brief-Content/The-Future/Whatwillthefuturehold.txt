The future for drones looks to be very promising. The Federal Aviation Authorities are slowly moving towards establishing a full set of commercial drone regulations, as the inevitable “drone boom” is sure to come around. In the future, drones can have the possibility of delivering items to your house, as Amazon has taken an initiative towards. Drones can also have the possibility of assisting in the food services industry. The transportation of food is important, and time sensitive. Drones allow for even faster travel time than before, allowing the food to remain fresh throughout the journey. Drones could also end up being incorporated into medical technology. If, for example, a hospital doesn’t have the right equipment to get certain data, it can have a drone leave towards a larger hospital with the right equipment, test it, and return the results faster than it would take nowadays. Drones have a bright future ahead, and are certain to take off within the next few years.
