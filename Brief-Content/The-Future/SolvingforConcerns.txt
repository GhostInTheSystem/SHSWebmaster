There are solutions to the general safety and privacy concerns brought up by critics of the commercial drones. The privacy concerns are being dealt with, as state legislature can draw up the legal framework needed to restrict drone use and avoid blatant privacy violations. IF the government isn’t able to pass all of the framework that is needed, the private sector can finish the rest. Ideas include a device that would recognize what is considered the “acoustic signature” of the drone, and then alert the individual of its presence in the area. 
	The safety concerns with drones include the fear of a UAV losing all necessary motor functions and plummeting out of the sky. That same concern can be applied to passenger air travel, and airplanes don’t continuously plummet out of the sky. Drones would be constructed to have failsafes. One benefit to having four motors powering a drone would be the fact that if one motor fails, there are three other motors online which can assist in making a safe landing. Another concern is the off chance that the drone hits something, not only damaging the expensive flying machine but potentially damaging whatever it hits. The drone community has looked toward using sense and avoid technologies built into the drones, to allow them to detect obstacles around them and avoid a collision.
