Drones provide the means for gathering large amounts of data. In agriculture alone, drones ability to photograph the large scale farms in order to gather information for pesticide use and watering. The research gleaned from using UAV technology can be used to make farmers farm more efficiently, i.e. water use aTnd pesticide use. UAV technology can also be used for environmental studies. Craig McDonald from Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary said that “research offshore is expensive and if this affords a lower cost alternative, that’s a big boon.” Drones allow research to be conducted far from where the UAV is actually launched. Drones allow for research to be conducted on sea life and even used to map the ocean floor. The research drones can provides is massive, and can come at a lower cost.
