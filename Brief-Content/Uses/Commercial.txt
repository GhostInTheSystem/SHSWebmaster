Drone technology has the potential to be used for many different things. Businesses are looking towards drones because of the one big difference between your mailman and a drone carrying your mail: the human. Drones do need to be flown by a pilot, but these pilots can operate drones at a remote location. The reduction in costs associated with labor has been what businesses have fallen in love with. 
One effective use of drones would be for delivery. Amazon, has already taken an initiative to begin using drones to deliver packages to its customers, instead of relying on the US Postal Service. A team of engineers in California also created the “Burrito Bomber”, a drone that uses GPS coordinates to parachute burritos. There has also been some interest in allowing for beer which can be drone delivered.
	Another effective use for drones is the ability to use them as movable wireless access points, giving Internet access to the remote areas of the world. Mark Zuckerberg, the famous founder of Facebook, has already attempted the purchase of Titan Aerospace (a company which builds solar-powered drones) in order to provide internet access worldwide using his Internet.org initiative.
	Other uses include replacing massive news choppers with silent small drones which can navigate better and fit into smaller places, using it to take photos for headcounts, or even real estate. Agriculture is another area where drones could make a large impact, with large scale farmers using UAS to monitor crop growth and make fertilizing easier and faster.
