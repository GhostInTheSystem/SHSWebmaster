The use of drones has seen an increase at the college level. Several universities and colleges have begun creating drone programs and classes to help prepare students for what they foresee as a future in drones. In fact, Georgia’s Clark County Career Academy has started a drone piloting program. Colleges are not only teaching students about drones and how to fly them, but they are also immersing them in UAS technology. The University of South Florida, for example, plans to lend two high-quality drones out to students through a library checkout system. Imperial College London, in the United Kingdom, is in the process of building a state of the art drone lab. Located near the university’s manufacturing facilities, lab students will be be able to make creation of drones a focal point. A professor at the University of Oregon has involved drones in his art projects. Students learn not only how to handle the technology, but also learn how to professionally edit the footage and turn in into an “artistic vision”.
