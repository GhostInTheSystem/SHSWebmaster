I love teaching Early Childhood Education (Preschool), Child Development and Interior Design here at Skyline!  I grew up in Salt Lake City and graduated from Utah State University. I earned a bachelor's degree in Family and Consumer Science and a Masters' degree in Special Education.  I taught at Churchill Junior High for 10  years before taking a break to raise my 3 daughters.  I love being active outdoors, my family, being busy, contributing and learning!
